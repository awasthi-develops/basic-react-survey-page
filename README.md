//Creating Repo

Parking Changes for Basic React application for Mathematics quiz using survey-react package.

//First update

Added handling for rendering quiz questions through an API using axios library.
Data is pulled from a local JSON file question-bank.json and rendered in class component using componentDidMount method.
Also added a custom hook which can be used ahead to handle multiple API calls.
